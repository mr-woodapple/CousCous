# CousCous (HouseholdProject)
Simple app build in React Native to create (and in the future share) a shopping list & receipes in a family or with friends.
Build with React Native (bare workflow).

# To-do list:
- [x] Implement receipes details screen
- [x] Fix bottom sheet always coming up on first app start
- [x] Add Spotify like header bar for categories
- [x] Add duration and difficulty to receipes
- [ ] Add dimensions to ingredients
- [ ] Add "nothing here" illustrations to receipes, categories & shopping list
- [ ] Implement login animation if the user has saved his credentials (covering the login screen)
- [ ] Add parralax functionality & image to detail screen
- [ ] Implement sharing functionality for receipes and shopping list
- [x] Style login screen
- [ ] Implement loading animation for receipes & shopping list -> stop when items have loaded
- [ ] Move often used functions & values / colors / headings into seperate files
- [ ] Add darkmode (& user selectable color-schemes?)
- [ ] Add tablet view (with sidebar like spotify, select item above and then display receipes below)
- [ ] Rebuild to work offline as standard and only create account if wanted -> use async? LOW PRIORITY
